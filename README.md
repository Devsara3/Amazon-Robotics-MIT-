The Intrinsic Matrix is the core geometric model defining the camera's geometry. The Distortion Coefficients are necessary for high precision and cleanliness, ensuring the image data entering the reprojection step is faithful to the real-world scene.

The Left Image is crucial for 3D reconstruction in stereo systems (like Tsukuba) for two main reasons: coordinate definition and texture application.1. 🖼️ Reference Camera (Geometric Definition)The left image is chosen as the reference camera for depth calculation:Stereo Standard: The disparity map (.pgm) stores the value of the pixel displacement relative to the left image. The stereo system's 3D reprojection formula is built assuming the left camera is the origin of the coordinate system.3D Decoding: Open3D uses the Intrinsic Matrix ($\mathbf{K}$) of the left camera to project the disparity/depth map back into 3D space. The formula $Z = (f \cdot B) / d$ calculates the depth $Z$ in the left camera's frame of reference.2. 🎨 Texture and Color Source (Visual Fidelity)The 3D Point Cloud needs color to be visually faithful to the scene:Color Mapping: The left image (.ppm) is used to assign color to every 3D point.Procedure: For every pixel $(u, v)$ in the left image, the system uses the depth $Z$ (derived from the disparity map) to calculate the metric position $(X, Y, Z)$ in space. It then takes the RGB value from that same pixel $(u, v)$ in the left image and attaches it to the 3D point.In summary, the Left Image is the geometric and visual starting point for all 3D reconstruction within the stereo workflow.
